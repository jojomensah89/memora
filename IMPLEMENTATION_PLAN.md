## üé® Design Workflow

### Step 1: Generate UI Mockups

Before coding each feature, generate UI mockups:

1. Open [Google Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/)
2. Copy relevant prompt from `GOOGLE_STITCH_PROMPTS.md`
3. Generate multiple variations
4. Select best design
5. Export as PNG or Figma

**Recommended order**:
1. Main Dashboard Layout
2. Chat Message Components
3. Context Panel
4. Model Selector
5. Chat Input Area
6. All others as needed

### Step 2: Reference During Implementation

- Keep mockups open while coding
- Match colors, spacing, borders to design
- Use Shadcn components for consistency
- Test in both light and dark themes

---

## üíª Development Workflow

### Daily Routine

1. **Morning**:
   - Review previous day's work
   - Pick next prompt from CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md
   - Generate UI mockup if needed
   - Read prompt carefully

2. **Development**:
   - Give full prompt to AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
   - Review generated code
   - Test thoroughly
   - Fix issues
   - Commit changes

3. **Testing**:
   - Test in browser (both themes)
   - Test on mobile viewport
   - Check database changes
   - Verify no console errors

4. **End of Day**:
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to GitHub
   - Update progress tracker
   - Plan tomorrow's tasks

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/chat-streaming
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add chat streaming with Vercel AI SDK"
git push origin feature/chat-streaming

# Merge to main when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/chat-streaming
git push origin main
```

### Testing Strategy

**After each prompt**:
- [ ] Visual test: Does it look right?
- [ ] Functional test: Does it work as expected?
- [ ] Edge cases: What if empty? What if error?
- [ ] Data test: Is data saved correctly to DB?
- [ ] Console: No errors or warnings?

**Before moving to next phase**:
- [ ] All features in phase working
- [ ] No known bugs
- [ ] Code committed to Git
- [ ] Tested in both themes

## üí° Tips for Success

### Working with AI Assistant

1. **Be specific**: Give full context, reference designs
2. **Review code**: Don't blindly accept, understand what it does
3. **Test thoroughly**: AI code often needs tweaks
4. **Iterate**: If output isn't right, ask for refinements
5. **Break down**: If prompt is too complex, split into smaller tasks

### Staying Motivated

1. **Celebrate wins**: Each completed feature is progress
2. **Visual progress**: See the UI come to life
3. **Share updates**: Tweet progress, share with friends
4. **Take breaks**: Don't burn out, pace yourself
5. **Ship early**: Get feedback from real users ASAP

### Debugging

1. **Use React DevTools**: Inspect component state
2. **Use Prisma Studio**: View/edit database visually
3. **Use Network tab**: Debug API calls
4. **Add console.logs**: When in doubt, log it out
5. **Ask for help**: Discord communities are friendly
