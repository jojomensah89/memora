## What is Memora?

Memora is an AI-powered chat application that solves the context problem. Instead of repeatedly copying files, docs, and code snippets into every conversation, users can:

- **Upload once, use everywhere**: Files, URLs, GitHub repos, and custom rules
- **Organize intelligently**: Tag and categorize context for easy discovery
- **Collaborate seamlessly**: Share context across your organization
- **Control costs**: Track token usage and manage spending limits
- **Work flexibly**: Fork conversations at any point, share chats via links

Inspired by [Conare](https://conare.ai/), but designed for web-based chat applications like Claude.ai and Gemini.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ Multi-Provider AI Chat
- Support for Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and OpenAI

### üìö Context Management
- **Upload Files**: PDFs, Markdown, code files, documents
- **Add URLs**: Automatic content extraction and cleaning
- **GitHub Integration**: Select specific files/folders from repos
- **Vibe-Rules**: Custom instructions and coding patterns
- **Smart Selection**: Choose which context to include per message
- **Token Counting**: See exactly how much context you're using

### üë• Organizations & Teams
- Create or join organizations
- Invite team members via email
- **Local Context**: Private to you

Clean, modern interface inspired by Linear and Vercel:
- Dual theme support (light and dark)
- Three-column layout for efficient workflow
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible and keyboard-friendly

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- Next.js 15.5+ with App Router (typed routes)
- React 19 with TypeScript 5.8
- Shadcn UI (New York) + Tailwind CSS v4
- Zustand for state management
- TanStack Query v5 for server state

**Backend**:
- Hono v4 (lightweight API framework)
- tRPC v11 for type-safe APIs
- Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- Better Auth v1.3+ for authentication
- Vercel AI SDK v5 for streaming

**Infrastructure**:
- Bun v1.3+ (runtime and package manager)
- S3-compatible storage for files
- Email service (Resend) for invites
- Vercel for deployment
- Sentry for error tracking

‚ö†Ô∏è **See `TECH_STACK_UPDATES.md`** for important differences from typical setups (Tailwind v4, OKLCH colors, React 19 patterns)
