# Memora Project Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers working on the Memora project. It outlines the project's architecture, key technologies, and essential commands.

## Project Overview

Memora is a full-stack application built with the Better-T-Stack, a modern TypeScript-based stack. It features a monorepo structure managed by Turborepo and uses Bun as the package manager.

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend (`apps/web`):**
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for building the user interface.
  - [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Reusable UI components.

- **Backend (`apps/server`):**
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev/): A small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the edge.
  - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/): Enables end-to-end typesafe APIs between the server and client.

- **Database (`packages/db`):**
  - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
  - [SQLite/Turso](https://turso.tech/): The database engine.

- **Shared Packages:**
  - `packages/api`: Contains the tRPC routers and shared API logic.
  - `packages/auth`: Handles authentication logic.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

    This project uses SQLite with Prisma. The database schema is defined in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.

    - Start the local database:
      ```bash
      cd apps/server && bun db:local
      ```
    - Update the `.env` file in `apps/server` with your database connection string if necessary.
    - Push the database schema:
      ```bash
      bun db:push
      ```

3.  **Run the Development Servers:**

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    - The web application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.
    - The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

All commands should be run from the root of the project.

- `bun run dev`: Starts all applications in development mode.
- `bun run dev:web`: Starts only the Next.js web application.
- `bun run dev:server`: Starts only the Hono backend server.
- `bun run build`: Builds all applications for production.
- `bun run check-types`: Runs TypeScript type checking across the entire monorepo.

### Database Commands

- `bun run db:push`: Pushes the current Prisma schema to the database.
- `bun run db:studio`: Opens the Prisma Studio to view and edit data.
- `bun run db:generate`: Generates the Prisma Client based on the schema.
- `bun run db:migrate`: Creates and applies a new database migration.

## Development Conventions

- **Code Style:** This project uses Biome for code formatting and linting. It is recommended to use the VS Code extension for Biome.
- **Git Hooks:** Husky is used to enforce code quality with a pre-commit hook that runs linting and type-checking.
- **API Development:** New tRPC routers should be added in the `packages/api/src/routers` directory and then merged into the main app router in `packages/api/src/root.ts`.
